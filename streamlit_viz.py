    ## MSI-Net Model Documentation
    
    ### Overview of MSI-Net
    The Multi-Scale Integration Network (MSI-Net) is a cutting-edge deep learning model designed for saliency detection in images. Saliency detection aims to identify the most important or attention-grabbing parts of an image, which can be crucial for various applications, including image editing, advertising, and content creation. MSI-Net leverages a sophisticated architecture that processes images at multiple scales, allowing it to capture a broad range of salient features from fine details to significant image components. By integrating information across these scales, MSI-Net achieves high precision in highlighting salient regions of an image, making it a powerful tool for researchers and developers working in the field of computer vision and image processing. Our work on this is based on Alexander Kronerâ€™s work, which can be found in a Github repo [here](https://github.com/alexanderkroner/saliency).

    This is a demo of the Saliency Map Visualizer. To use it, upload an image
    and click the button below. Please note, it may take up to 20 seconds to visualise.
